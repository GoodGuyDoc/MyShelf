This project is a book tracker used to catalog, search, and track the status of books.

The project primarily uses .NET 8 (C# 12), Sqlite, React + TypeScript

# Goals of the project

The main goal of this project was to learn more about building .NET API based React applications.
There are plenty of code comments throughout the project, this is for my own personal tracking and learning
I will likely add a lessons learned once I complete every major section of this project.
