 MyShelf 📚

A personal book tracker for cataloging, searching, and keeping tabs on what you're reading.

---

## What is this?

MyShelf is a full-stack book tracking app built primarily to learn more about .NET API development with a React frontend. You'll find code comments throughout the project — this is mainly for my own tracking as I work through things. I'll also be adding a lessons learned section once I finish each major part of the project.

Cheers!

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Backend | .NET 8 / C# 12 |
| Database | SQLite |
| Frontend | React + TypeScript |

## Note on AI Usage

The main goal here is learning C# API development and React, so I've been pretty deliberate about what I use AI for:

1. **Learning & clarification** — Understanding docs and concepts
2. **Large repetitive changes** — Things like adding exception handling across a lot of files
3. **Formatting comments & docs** — Only after I've done it manually a couple times first
